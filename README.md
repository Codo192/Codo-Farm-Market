# Codo-Farm-Market-
The application that I am designing for my capstone project is “Codo Farm  Market”.  I have a local farm where I grow all organic vegetables and fruit.  Customers from all around the town shop in my farm store. With this application,  local customers can order fresh organic vegetables and fruits online ahead of time  for pick up or delivery. This project will help to promote my business and help the  business to grow at the same time.  I hope that this process also helps customers  minimize their wait time and for those who have difficulty interacting with others  due to our current covid situation to have a smooth transition with fewer people  interactions.
